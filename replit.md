# Findawise Empire - Neuron Federation Core

## Overview
This project is a full-stack JavaScript application built as the core system for the Findawise Empire's Neuron Federation. It features a Node.js/Express backend and React frontend, designed to manage and orchestrate specialized modules (Neuron types) across various verticals like Finance, Health & Wellness, SaaS, Travel, Security, and Education. The system incorporates AI-powered personalization, dynamic quiz engines, sophisticated content management, affiliate link tracking, advanced analytics, and multilingual localization. The vision is to provide a high-performance, secure, and scalable platform capable of supporting a multi-billion dollar enterprise with enterprise-grade AI-native capabilities, self-healing systems, and migration-proof architecture.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Requires billion-dollar empire grade systems only - no compromises
Focus on enterprise-scale architecture and security
Prefer comprehensive system hardening over quick fixes
Values detailed audit reports and validation documentation
Frontend must be "the greatest of all" - world-class enterprise interface to match sophisticated billion-dollar backend systems
Deployment Goal: Wants to deploy on own custom domain for complete control and branding

## System Architecture
The Findawise Empire is architected for enterprise-grade performance, security, and scalability.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express server, designed with a microservices approach featuring a federation-style module system. It includes modular route systems and self-healing capabilities.
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, utilizing modern UI components from Shadcn/UI and Radix UI. The design emphasizes a premium feel with dark gradient themes, glassmorphism effects, and advanced micro-interactions. It supports PWA capabilities and mobile optimization.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, featuring over 450 operational tables. Key architectural decisions include:
    - **AI/ML Infrastructure**: Integrated multi-provider LLM support, vector embeddings, and a RAG pipeline for advanced AI capabilities. This includes an Empire Brain Intelligence Layer for centralized AI/ML orchestration, RLHF + Persona Fusion Engine, Knowledge Memory Graph, and a Zero-Shot Prompt Optimizer.
    - **Security Framework**: Implements bank-grade authentication (JWT), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), API Key Vault, comprehensive compliance audit trails, and self-healing security systems.
    - **Business Intelligence**: Includes robust systems for revenue tracking, conversion optimization, affiliate network management, and a Smart Funnel Generator with AI-powered orchestration.
    - **Auto-Healing Systems**: Incorporates self-repair mechanisms, performance optimization, and continuous monitoring for high availability, including a Codex Auto-Audit Engine with automated fix generation.
    - **Migration-Proof Design**: Ensures zero-data-loss backup/restore processes, cross-platform compatibility, and resilience against database changes, including an Ultra Migration-Proof Export/Import System.
    - **Federation OS**: A core system for managing and orchestrating various Neuron modules, enabling real-time communication, health monitoring, and cross-neuron intelligence sharing.
    - **Dynamic Page Generation**: A framework-independent system for dynamically generating web pages from a central configuration, supporting emotion-based theming, interactive modules, and SEO optimization.
    - **Realtime Layout Mutation Engine**: Server-driven dynamic layouts with AI-powered optimization.
    - **Notification & Email Lifecycle Engine**: AI-powered journey builder with multi-channel automation.
    - **Compliance & Privacy Engine**: Global regulatory framework support (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA) with advanced consent management.
- **Technical Implementations**: Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution, manages database migrations via Drizzle Kit, and supports both PostgreSQL and Supabase adapters. The application is designed for high availability with built-in fallback systems and enterprise-grade monitoring, including a Live API Diff Tracker.
